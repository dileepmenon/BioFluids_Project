This is a python based project to simulate the motion of
[cilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium) due to
hydrodynamic interaction. In this work a simple tilted conical motion of a
single cilia is considered to study its effect on the flow field.
Video of actual cilia beating movement can be found
