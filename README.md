This is a python based project to simulate the motion of
[cilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilium) due to
hydrodynamic interactions. The cilia is modelled as a chain of N-magnetic beads, 
wherein a time varying external magnetic field is applied such that it
undergoes a tilted conical motion. Further the effect of this motion on flow
field is observed. Video of actual cilia beating can be found
